1. Conga
Conga is an integrated set of software components that provides centralized configuration and management of Red Hat clusters and storage. Conga provides the following major features:

o	One Web interface for managing cluster and storage
o	Automated Deployment of Cluster Data and Supporting Packages
o	Easy Integration with Existing Clusters
o	No Need to Re-Authenticate
o	Integration of Cluster Status and Logs
o	Fine-Grained Control over User Permissions

The primary components in Conga are luci and ricci, which are separately installable. 
luci is a server that runs on one computer and communicates with multiple clusters and computers via ricci.
 ricci is an agent that runs on each computer (either a cluster member or a standalone computer) managed by Conga.

LVS	pulse	This is the controlling process which starts all other daemons related to LVS routers. At boot time, the daemon is started by the /etc/rc.d/init.d/pulse script. It then reads the configuration file /etc/sysconfig/ha/lvs.cf. On the active LVS router, pulse starts the LVS daemon. On the backup router, pulse determines the health of the active router by executing a simple heartbeat at a user-configurable interval. If the active LVS router fails to respond after a user-configurable interval, it initiates failover. During failover, pulse on the backup LVS router instructs the pulse daemon on the active LVS router to shut down all LVS services, starts the send_arp program to reassign the floating IP addresses to the backup LVS router's MAC address, and starts the lvs daemon.
 	lvsd	The lvs daemon runs on the active LVS router once called by pulse. It reads the configuration file /etc/sysconfig/ha/lvs.cf, calls the ipvsadm utility to build and maintain the IPVS routing table, and assigns a nanny process for each configured LVS service. If nannyreports a real server is down, lvsinstructs the ipvsadm utility to remove the real server from the IPVS routing table.
 	ipvsadm	This service updates the IPVS routing table in the kernel. The lvs daemon sets up and administers LVS by calling ipvsadm to add, change, or delete entries in the IPVS routing table.
 	nanny	The nanny monitoring daemon runs on the active LVS router. Through this daemon, the active LVS router determines the health of each real server and, optionally, monitors its workload. A separate process runs for each service defined on each real server.
 	lvs.cf	This is the LVS configuration file. The full path for the file is /etc/sysconfig/ha/lvs.cf. Directly or indirectly, all daemons get their configuration information from this file.
 	Piranha Configuration Tool	This is the Web-based tool for monitoring, configuring, and administering LVS. This is the default tool to maintain the /etc/sysconfig/ha/lvs.cf LVS configuration file.
 	send_arp	This program sends out ARP broadcasts when the floating IP address changes from one node to another during failover.
Quorum Disk	qdisk	A disk-based quorum daemon for CMAN / Linux-Cluster.
 	mkqdisk	Cluster Quorum Disk Utility.
 	qdiskd	Cluster Quorum Disk Daemon.
