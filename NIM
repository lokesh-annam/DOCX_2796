				NETWORK INSTALLATION MANAGEMENT
========================================================================>
By Using NIM Configuration/NIM Server, we can perform the OS Installations, TL Upgrades, and any optional softwares (java, sap etc) 
installation through network, without cd-rom interruption.
The main advantage of the nim server we can perform any installations at a time on bulk of servers.
In NIM configuration, Network is the main role to perform the installations.

NIM SERVER CONFIGURATION/TO BUILD NIM SERVER:
a) Create NIM Server/Lpar
b) Install Aix OS (5.3,6.1 or 7.1) on NIM Server.
c) Install the NIM supported file sets /softwares on the NIM Server from the same OS CD.
NOTE: If server is running with 6.1 version, NIM supported file sets we have to install from 6.1 CD only.
# installp -agXY -d /dev/cd0 bos.sysmgt.nim.master bos.sysmgt.nim.spot
	(or) 
# smitty install -> Install and update software -> Install software -> INPUT device/ director for software [/dev/cd0]
	* INPUT device 				/ directory for software 	/dev/cd0
	* SOFTWARE to install 		[Select Nim software]			+ 
	COMMIT software updates? 				No 					+
	SAVE replaced files? 					yes 				+
	EXTEND file systems if space needed?	yes 				+
	DETAILED output? 						yes 				+
	ACCEPT new license agreements? 			yes 				+
	
# lslpp -l |grep -i nim 	--> To list installed nim file sets.
NOTE: bos.sysmgt.nim.client file sets will be install, when we are installing operating system. if 
	we need to configure any aix server as NIM server we have to install master and spot file sets.

d) Configure the NIM Network:
	Configure the IP address for available ethernet adapter then proceed with below steps
	smitty nim
	Configure the nim environment
	Advance Configuration
	Initialize the NIM Master only
	* Network Name [nim_network]
	* Primary Network Install Interface [en0]
# lsnim -c networks
nim_network networks ent
NOTE: Once configure the nim network, two nim demons will be started such as: nimesis, nimd

e) Configure the lpp_source: 
	lpp_source Defination: lpp_source is a resouce in NIM server, in lpp_source file system we will copy the OS images from the CD so it is equal to OS cd only. 
	by using lpp_source we can install OS on multiple nim clients at a time.
NOTE: before configure lpp_source we have to create the one lpp_source file system to store/copy the OS images.
	(Ex: /export/lpp_source or /export/nim/lpp_source)
	Ex:
	# crfs -v jfs2 -g nimvg -a size=10G -A yes -m /export/lpp_source
	# mount /export/lpp_source
NOTE: 
1) lpp_source file system minimum 5G size required to copy one version OS.
2) lpp_source file system we can create any one of the VG, which VG we are having free space.
	Once create lpp_source file system follow below steps to copy OS images from CD to FS (/export/lpp_source).
	# smitty nim
	> Perform nim administration tasks
	> Manage Resources
	> Define a resource
	> Select the resouce "lpp_source"
	> Fill the below final window
	 *Resource Name [lpp5304]
	 *Resource Type [lpp_source]
	 *Server of Resource [master]
	 *Location of Resource [/export/lpp_source]
	 source of installation images [cd0]
NOTE: once click enter cd0 images will copy into /export/lpp_source file system.
	lpp_source configuration will take 30 to 45 minutes, if we have more free memory and CPU, it will take 10 to 20 minutes time.

f) Configure the SPOT:
	SPOT Definition: SPOT stands for Shared Product Object Tree, SPOT we can configure from the lpp_source or mksysb resources, 
	if we need to installp OS (lpp_source) or rootvg mksysb restoration we should configure the respected spot for them. without spot we canâ€™t install OS 
	(lpp_source) or we can not restore rootvg mksysb backup.
	SPOT is equal to /usr file system, it is contain the booting related commands, the nim clients initially boot from the SPOT only.
	Before configure the SPOT we need to create separate file system to store SPOT related data. Minimum 512MB space is required to configure one OS version spot.
	
	EX: /export/spot or /export/nim/spot
	# crfs -v jfs2 -g nimvg -a size=5G -A yes -m /export/spot
	# mount /export/spot
NOTE: minimum spot file system space is required 512MB to store one version OS or one server mksysb. 
	Once spot file system created & mounted follow the below steps to configure the spot from lpp_source.
	# smitty nim
	> Perform nim Administration tasks
	> Manage Resources
	> Define a Resource
	> Select a resource "spot"
	> fill the below final window step
	 *Resource Name [spot5304]
	 *Resource type [spot]
	 *Server of Resource [master]
	 *Source of Install images [lpp5304]
	 *Location of resource [/export/spot]
	Once filled fields hit enter to configure the spot from lpp_source.

g) Configure the NIM Client:
	Before configure the nim client we have to add client server IP and hostname in /etc/hosts file on NIM Server. 
	once added client entries on /etc/hosts file follow the below steps to configure the nim client.
	# smitty nim
	> Perform NIM Administration tasks
	> Manage Machines
	> Define a machine
	 *Host name of the machine [nimclient1]
	hit two times enter, client will be configure.
	# lsnim -c machines 	--> To list the configured client servers.

TO REMOVE THE NIM CONFIGURATION:
	1) #smitty nim --> perform nim admin tasks -> unconfigure nim
	2) remove the nim file systems
	3) uninstall nim softwares
	6) Add/Allocate the resources (lpp_source & spot) to nim clients, on which are the servers we have to install OS.
		a) #smitty nim_bosinst
		b) Select the client server (ex: sapserver),
		c) Select Installation Environment Ex: rte for lpp_source installation.
		d) Select the lpp_source which version going to install [ex: 5.3) "lpp5304"
		e) Select respected spot Ex: "spot5304"
		On Final window fill the below steps.
		* Installation Target [aix3]
		*Installation Type [rte]
		*Spot [spot5304]
		*lpp_source [lpp5304]
		Accept License Agreement [yes]
		Force PUSH Installation [no]
		Initiate reboot and Install now [no]
		Accept new license Agreement [yes]
NOTE: Before install OS, we need add the minimum below hardware configuration.
	a) one hard disk (minimum 5 to 10G)
	b) One Ethernet Adapter (Network)
	c) Minimum CPU and Memory.
	7) Go to client side to install the OS by using below steps.
		Once added required hardware, Start/Activate the server and enter SMS menu.
		Select Server -> Operations -> Activate --> Profile --> Advanced --> Select SMS menu --> click OK	
		Once we have entered into SMS menu we have to perform below two steps to start installation.
		a) ping test between nim server & client server
		b) Select first boot device as Ethernet adapter because installation will done through the network.
		a) PING TEST STEPS:
		1) Enter SMS menu
		2) Select "Setup Remote IPL (initial program load)
		3) Select the Ethernet adapter 
		4) Select the "IP Parameters" option to add Server & Client IPs
		5) Once added IPs, return back previous window (esc)
		6) Select the "Ping test" option.
		7) Execute the ping test by select number "1"
		b) SELECT FIRST BOOT DEVICE AS NETWORK ADAPTER FOLLOW THE BELOW 
STEPS:
	1) Come to the Main menu in SMS (m)
	2) Select boot options (5)
	3) Configure boot device order (2)
	4) Select 1st boot device (1)
	5) Select Network (6)
	6) Select the Ethernet adapter as 1st boot device 
	7) Select Set boot sequence: configure 1st boot device (2).
	8) Select number "1" Ethernet adapter device
	9) Exit from SMS menu.
NEXT: Once exit from SMS menu Installation will start then follow/select the installations options as usual like cd installation.
	1) Define Console window
	2) Slect Language English
	3) Installation setting window, here three options
	a) Default settings
	b) Change/Show installation settings
	c) Maintenance mode
	Once setting completed select "1" and "0" to proceed with installation.

TO REMOVE NETWORK:
	Smitty nim
	Perform NIM Administration Tasks
	Manage Networks
	Remove a Network
	Select the Network, which is need to remove.
	click enter button two times.
	To Install OS on servers by using NIM server.
	Follow the below steps on NIM Server:
	1) Configure the NIM Server
	2) Configure the NIM Network
	3) Configure the lpp_source
	4) Configure the spot
	5) Configure the NIM Client
	6) Add the resources (lpp_source and SPOT ) to the nim clients.
	7) Go to client side install the OS by using below steps.
TROUBLESHOOTINGS:
	Problem: Ping test fails
	Find the issue:
	1) Verify adapters state on NIM server and Clients.
	2) Verify Interfaces state both sides
	3) Verify the LAN cables link status.
	4) IP Parameters may be wrong.

PROBLEM2:
	Once assigned resources to client. Client not booting to install OS via NIM.
	Reasons:
	1) Verify the ping test. if success then
	2) May be bootd / tftpd demons not running on NIM server
		# bootps -d -d -d -d -d
	3) May be /etc/niminfo file missing on NIM server
	4) may be lpp_source or SPOT not good /not configured properly.

NIM ACTIVITIES:
	0) Configure NIM Server
	1) How to install OS on new servers through NIM Server. (or) How to install OS by using lpp_source on NIM clients.
	2) How to perform Migration Installation through NIM Server on nim clients.
	3) How to take the mksysb backup of nim clients on NIM Servers.
	4) How to restore mksysb backup on nim clients by using NIM Server.
	5) How to perform TL Upgrade on NIM Clients via NIM server.
(II) How to perform Migration Installation through NIM Server on nim clients.
	We can perform migration installation two ways on nim clients by using nim server.
	1) Manually we can assign the latest version resources to nim clients perform the pull method.
	2) By using "nimadm" command we can perform.

MIGRATION INSTALLATION VIA NIMADM COMMAND:
	nimadm is one of the advanced feature in NIM installations, when we are Migrating OS from lower version to higher version we can use "#nimadm" command to perform the migration 
	installation. Once executed nimadm command on nim server, the command will run the 12 Phases/Steps to complete Migrations Installation on client side.
	Ex: sapserver is nim client and running with 5.3 version. Now how to migrate sapserver with 6.1 version through nimadm.
	FOLLOW THE BELOW STEPS TO MIGRATE OS.
	PRE-WORKS:
	1) Take one empty hard disk on nim client (sapserver) Ex: hdisk1.
	2) Make sure network communication between nim server and client by adding both servers IPs on /etc/hosts both sides.
	3) Configure the 6.1 version lpp_source and spot.
	4) Configure the sapserver client server
	5) /etc/niminfo file should be presented on nim server and nim client side also (aix1).
	6) Enable the NIM operation permissions to nim server on nim clients. 
	7) Nim client side and NIM server alt_rootvg supported file sets should be installed.
		bos.alt_disk_install.rte
		bos.alt_disk_install.boot_images
		Resources: lpp6108 and spot6108
	NIM client: sapserver, Empty disk: hdisk1
NIMADM COMMAND:
NOTE: nimadm command we will run on the NIM Server.
	# nimadm -j <vgname> -l <lpp_source> -s <spot> -c <client server> -d <client emptydisk> -Y
	EX:# nimadm -j nimvg -l lpp6108 -s spot6108 -c sapserver -d hdisk1 -Y
	j - vgname means on Which VG lpp_source & Spot file systems are presented.
	-l -> lpp source name, which OS version going to Migrate/Install
	-s -> respected SPOT of lpp_source
	-c -> Client server name, which is going to Migrate
	-d->Client side empty Hard disk to create Clone/alt rootvg
	-Y -> Accept the licence aggrement.
	Once executed nimadm command it will run the below 12 phases to completed migration installation.
	NIMADM 12 PHASES:
	1) It will create the alternate rootvg on nim client.
	2) Nim server will export the all alternate file systems (with read/write permissions).
	3) On clients side old rootvg data will take backup and it will restore on the altinst_rootvg.
	4) Pre-migration script will be execute.
	5) Client server configuration files will be saved.
	6) All old version OS packages will be migrated with new version packages
	7) Once OS packages migrated, Post-Migration script will be executed.
	8) #bosboot command will create boot image on alternate_rootvg disk
	9) all alt filesystem will be removed from NIM server.
	10) alt filesystems are mounted on nim client.
	11) again alt_disk_install command will run to verify final adjustments in altinst_rootvg status.
	12) bootlist order will created as (hdisk1) and reboot the system.

MKSYSB BACKUP AND RESTORE THROUGH NIM SERVER:
MKSYSB BACKUP VIA NIM:
	mksysb backup we can take two ways in nim server.
	1) Manually mksysb backup
	2) Automatically mksysb backup through NIM Server
	Nim Server: 192.168.1.200
	Nim client: 192.168.1.30
NOTE: All servers mksysb backups we will store under /export/nim/mksysb (or) /export/nim/image (or) /export/mksysb, /export/image file systems
	1) Manual nim clients mksysb backup:
	Create mksysb image on nim client and copy to the NIM server by using FTP or NFS.
	a) Login client server
	b) create mksysb image into any file system
		EX: #mksysb -ieX /tmp/mksysbfilename
	c) copy mksysb image on nim server under /export/nim/mksysb file system by using NFS or FTP
	2) Automatic mksysb backup on nim server:
	a) Login to the NIM Server and NIM client server.
	b) Verify the network communication between both servers
	c) Ensure the /etc/niminfo file should be present on both servers.
		# nimconfig -r -> To create /etc/niminfo file on NIM server.
	To create /etc/niminfo file on nim client server.
		# niminit (or) smitty nim -> Configure Network Installation Management Client Fileset -> fill below options
	* Machine Name [sapserver]
	* Primary Network Install Interface [en0] +
	* Host Name of Network Install Master [nimserver]
	d) Enable the NIM Server permissions on nim client side (ex:aix100)
		# smitty nim -> Manage Network Install permissions -> Select enable option -> enter
	e) Configure the NIM client on server. if already configured ignore this step (#lsnim -c machines)
	f) Take the mksysb backup by using below steps.
		# smitty nim
		> Perform NIM Administrations Tasks
		> Manage Resources
		> Define a Resource
		> Select mksysb resources "mksysb"
		> Fill the below fields in finally window.
		 *Resource Name [aix100_mksysb_08232016]
		 *Resource Type [mksysb]
		 *Server of Resource [master]
		 *Location of Resource [/export/mksysb/sapserver/sapserver_mksyb_5308] --> aix100_mksyb_5308 is rootvg image file name.

	f) Exit from SMS menu and follow the installation steps.
NOTE: Change show settings we can select installation type New and completed overwrite and same rootvg disk.

What is recent activity
What is recent troubleshooting
What is recent critical activity done
	ANS) One of the production server rootvg corrupted after TL upgrade installations/OS Migration then we have restored mksysb image from the NIM Server by using below steps.
	a) We have all servers rootvg images on /export/mksysb/ file system in NIM server.
	b) login to the nim server.
	c) Verified network communication between both servers
	d) Configured NIM mksysb by using rootvg image backup file.
	e) Configured spot
	f) Configured NIM client (sapserver)
	g) assgined resources to nim client
	f) enter into SMS menu in client, ping test and network selected first boot device, exit from sms menu.
	h) Follow the installation steps.
Note: The restoration will take time 45 minutes to 1 hour.
	TL Upgrade by Using NIM Server:
	TL Upgrade we can do two ways by using NIM server.
	1) By using NFS/FTP we can install TL packages
	2) By using lpp_source we can install TL Packages
Note: To install TL Packages SPOT is not required because client server already running with OS.
	1) To Install TL packages from 61-06 to 08 Level By using NFS/FTP.
		NIM Server: 192.168.1.200
		Client Server: 192.168.1.30
		TL Packages location : /export/softwares/TL08
		a) Take all pre-works on nim client before install TL packages
		b) Go to NIM Server export the /export/software file system.
		# vi /etc/exports
		/export/softwares
		:wq
		#exportfs -a
		c) Go to client side mount the NFS file system
		#showmount -e 192.168.1.200
		Op: /export/softwares
		#mkdir /local
		#mount 192.168.1.200:/export/softwares /local
		#cd /local/TL08
		#smitty update_all -> To update TL packages
	2) To Install TL Packages by using lpp_source
		1) Configure lpp_source
		2) Configure client

NIM Demons:
Nim network demons:
	1) nimesis
	2) nimd 
	above demons will create after configured network
	Client side booting supported demons are"
	3) bootpd
	4) bootps 
	5) tftpd 
NFS demons also main role in NIM
NIM CONFIGURATION FILES:
	/etc/niminfo 
	/etc/bootptap
	/etc/hosts
	/etc/exports
	/ftfpboot --> It is directory.
NIM PORTS:
	1058 --> NIM server port
	1059 --> NIM Registration port
	# /etc/niminfo: It is important nim configuration file should be presented on both sides to performa nim operations. 
		this file contains the nim server and client server hostnames, IPs and port numbers etc.
	# /etc/bootptab: This is one of the nim configuration file, once assigned the reources to nim client from 
		NIM server, one entry will create on /etc/bootptab.
NOTE: Once installation completed entry will remove from /tftpboot directory
Entry Format:
	nimclientname: client IP: nimserver IP: netmaskvalue
	Ex: aix100: ip=192.168.1.10:192.168.1.200:255.255.255.0
	/etc/hosts: This is network configuration file both sides should be presented with both servers IPs and Hostname
	/etc/exports: It is NFS configuration file in nim NFS is main role to perform the installations on nim clients. 
		NIM server export the nim file systems and import into client side in the time of lpp_source installations or mksysb restoration etc.
	/tftpboot: It is very important directory in NIM, once assigned the resources to client server 3 files/entries will create under /tftpboot, 
		after installation completed the entries will be remove from /tftpboot directory.
	3 ENTRIES FORMAT:
	a) file1
	sapserver_mksysbspot_53.chrp.mp.ent 
	sapserver - client server
	mksysbspot_53 -> Spot name
	chrp.mp.ent --> mp means 32 bit kernel
	chrp.64.ent --> 64 kernel
	b) file2
	sapserver -> /tftpboot/aix53spot.chrp.mp.ent 
	One soft link file will create with client name and spot file.
	c) file3
	sapserver.info
	this client information file, by using this file we can see installation completed percentage/information in the time of installation.
	#lsnim -a info (or) lsnim -a aix100 --> To see the client information/ Installation Percentage status.
