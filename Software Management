Software Management:-

A fileset is the smallest installable base unit for the AIX operating system (example: bos.perf.pefstat). A package is a group of separately installable filesets that provide a set of related functions (example: bos.perf). A Licensed Program Product (LPP) is a complete software product including all packages associated with that licensed program (example: bos). A bundle is a list of software that can contain filesets, packages, and LPPs that are suited for a particular use (examples: CDE, KDE, GNOME).
Each fileset in a product can be divided into three parts: usr, root, and share. Parceling of a software product is used for diskless and dataless clients. Thus it can be installed on one machine (the server) and then be used remotely by other machines on a network (the clients). 
The usr part of a software product can be shared by machines with the same hardware architecture (stored in /usr).
The root part (optional) of a software product cannot be shared by machines. In a client/server environment, these are the files for which there must be a unique copy for each client of a server. Most of the root software is associated with the configuration of the machine or product (stored in the root (/) file tree. The /etc/objrepos directory contains the root part of an installable software product's VPD).
The share part (optional) can be shared among machines, even if they have different hardware architectures.The share part of a product is always packaged in a separately installable package (stored in /usr/share).
The format for a software product level in AIX 5.2 is as follows: versionnumber.releasenumber.modificationlevel.fixlevel
