find . -name "*" -->. means current directory

Wild cards:- 
* - represents zero or more characters
? - represents a single character
[] - represents a range of characters
^ - We may also reverse a range using the caret ( ^ ) which means look for any character which is not one of the following.




zcat and gunzip:-

zcat & gunzip-->It will print the compress file content
	-->The zcat command is compatible with the gunzip –c command.

-f -->To print the file contented forcefully, we need to use the “-f” option with the zcat command
-l -->To print the compression information, we need to use the “-l” option with the zcat command.
-q -->Some times while printing any compress data, the lots of warning come. To avoid this condition, we need to use the “-q” option with the zcat command.

gzip [File_Name] -->compress the file in .gz extention





$(cat /etc/passwd |cut -d: -f1); do echo $user; chage -l $user | grep "Password expires"; done | paste -d " " - - | sed 's/Password expires//g' -->Password expiry status shell script

$ sudo vi /opt/scripts/user-password-expiration-date.sh

for user in $(cat /etc/passwd |cut -d: -f1)
do echo $user
chage -l $user | grep "Password expires"
done | paste -d " "  - - | sed 's/Password expires//g'


The below shell script will display the list of users (excluding system users) along with their password expiration date:

$ sudo vi /opt/scripts/user-password-expiration-date-1.sh

#!/bin/sh
for user in $(cat /etc/passwd |cut -d: -f1)
do echo $user
chage -l $user | grep "Password expires"
done | paste -d " "  - - | sed 's/Password expires//g' | grep -v "never"

Chapter 2. The Apache HTTP Server

rpm -q httpd -->to see if the httpd package is installed.
~]# yum install httpd -->run the following command as the root user to install it.
	Run the getenforce command to confirm SELinux is running in enforcing mode:
	
~]$ getenforce
Enforcing

	Run the service httpd start command as the root user to start httpd:
~]# service httpd start
	Starting httpd:                                            [  OK  ]

	The getenforce command returns Enforcing when SELinux is running in enforcing mode.
	
~]$ ps -eZ | grep httpd -->to view the httpd processes

/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf -->Configuration file.

~]# service httpd status -->command to confirm httpd is not running
	httpd is stopped
	
~]# service httpd stop -->command to stop the process
Stopping httpd:                                            [  OK  ]

~]# semanage port -l | grep -w http_port_t -->command to view the ports SELinux allows httpd to listen on:
http_port_t                    tcp      80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443

	Edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf as the root user. Configure the Listen option so it lists a port that is not configured in SELinux policy configuration for httpd. 
	In this example, httpd is configured to listen on port 12345:
	# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
	# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses (0.0.0.0)
	#
	#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
	Listen 127.0.0.1:12345
	
~]# service httpd start -->command to start httpd
	Starting httpd: (13)Permission denied: make_sock: could not bind to address 127.0.0.1:12345
	no listening sockets available, shutting down
	Unable to open logs					   [FAILED]
	
	An SELinux denial similar to the following is logged:
	setroubleshoot: SELinux is preventing the httpd (httpd_t) from binding to port 12345. For complete SELinux messages. 
	run sealert -l f18bca99-db64-4c16-9719-1db89f0d8c77
	
	For SELinux to allow httpd to listen on port 12345, as used in this example, the following command is required:
~]# semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 12345

	Run service httpd start again to start httpd and have it listen on the new port:
~]# service httpd start
	Starting httpd:						   [  OK  ]
