CHAPTER 11. PROBLEM DETERMINATION
ERROR LOG: By Using error log we can identify the system errors/problems, it is one of the advanced facility in Aix to identify the system software or hardware errors.

HARDWARE ERRORS:
Harddisk Failed
Adapters Failed
Adapters Link problems
Sysplanner Failed
VRM (Voltage Regulator Module) Failed
DIMM/Memory Failed
CD-ROM Errors
Tape Drive Errors
SOFTWARE ERRORS:
Low paging space
File systems problems
Logical volumes Problems
Super block corrupted
Application Problems
Deamons Problems etc.,
LOCATION:
/var/adm/ras/errorlog

# /usr/lib/errdemon -l		--> To read the confiration that errdemon is running.
# /usr/lib/errdemon -s <sizeinbytes> --> To Increase the errorlog.
# /usr/lib/errdemon -B buffer_size -i file_name -s file_size	--> the daemon runs with the default parameters: file name, size, and the amount of 
																	memory allocated to its buffer. 																	
# errpt			--> Display Information obtained from the current error log file.
# errpt -aj B6267342	--> For detailed information an error with the identifier.		
# errpt -a		--> Command and redirect the result to the file.
# errpt -j <IDname> 	--> To list the particular ID related errors,

# errpt -a -d H --> To list the hardware errors with full details.
# errpt -d O 	--> To list the other errors
# errpt |more
	IDENTIFIER: ID name of the error
	TIMESTAMP: The date & time of error generated.
	T/type: Type of error (TEMP/PERM/INFO/UNKN).
	C/Class: Class of error (Software/Hardware/OPERATOR)
	RESOURCE_NAME: What is main resource to generated error (Ex: hdisk, sysplanner, FS, LV 
	and Daemon).

CLEARING THE ERROR LOG (ERRCLEAR)															

# errclear 30			--> Deletes all entries older than 30 days.
# errclear -d S 30			--> Removes all S-class errors (software) older than 30 days.
# errclear -j 192AC071 3	--> Removes all errors with the id. 192AC071 older than three days.

# errclear -d H 0 		--> To clear Hardware errors
# errclear -d O 0		--> To clear Other errors
# errclear 0 			--> To clear total system errors (hardware/software/Othter etc.)
	NOTE: Before clear the errors take the backup of errorlog safe side to check old errors in future.
# errlogger "my test error in aix1 server" -> To generate the error into error log manually.
	NOTE: if errlog file not available or removed by some one. follow the below steps to create log file.
/usr/lib/errstop
/usr/lib/errdemon
Once stop/start the errdemon the errlog file will create automaticlly.

# crontab -l | grep err
0 11 * * * /usr/bin/errclear -d S,O 30 # Removes all software errors older than 30 days.
0 12 * * * /usr/bin/errclear -d H 90 # Removes all hardware errors older than 90 days.

/var/adm/ras/errlog			--> the error and the additional information are logged in the log file.
/etc/syslog.conf	--> Its configuration can be customized by modifying the configuration file.

DIAG

# diag -d fcs0 -c # Diagnostics of the fcs0 fiber channel adapter.

====================================================================================
				SYSTEM DUMP
====================================================================================
SYSTEM DUMP: it contains the information about system booting errors. (or) if system having any booting related problems, 
we can create/generate the System Dump file (vmcore file) to analyze the system booting related problems by IBM.
In Aix we have two dump devices 
1) primary dump device
2) secondary dump device
1) PRIMARY DUMP DEVICE:
	If real memory below 4GB (<4GB) primary dump device is /dev/hd6
	If real memory =>4GB primary dump device is /dev/lg_dumplv
2) SECONDARY DUMP DEVICE:
Default secondary dump device is /dev/sysdumpnull
NOTE: 
1) If we need additional dump devices, we can create by using #mklv command.
2) If primary dump device is /dev/hd6 or /dev/lg_dumplv, once generated dump file the vmcore file will create and copy into the /var/adm/ras location.
3) If primary dump device is /dev/sysdumpnull, once dump generated, vmcore file will create but 
	vmcore core will not copy into the /var/adm/ras location, because the vmcore file delete by the sysdumpnull.
	so if we need to create dump file (vmcore) we should not keep primary dump device as 
/dev/sysdumpnull.
PRE-CHECKS BEFORE CREATE DUMP FILE:
1) Estimate the dump size
2) Verify the /var file system size, /var file system free space should => estimated dump size.
# sysdumpdev -l --> To list the primary & secondary dump devices information.
# mklv -y <lvname> -t sysdump <vgname><nooflps><pvname>
# sysdumpdev -p /dev/dumplv --> To change the primary device temporarly.
# sysdumpdev -Pp /dev/dumplv --> To change the primary dump device permanently
# sysdumpdev -s /dev/dumplv --> To change the secondary dump device temporarly.
# sysdumpdev -P-s /dev/dumplv --> To change the secondary dump device permanently.
# sysdumpdev -e --> To estimate the dump file size before creating. the size it will list on bytes. 
	we can convert the bytes size into MBs to estimate required space on dump logical volumes (/dev/lg_dumplv etc.)
# sysdumpstart -p --> To create/generate system dump file (vmcore) from the primary dump device.
# sysdumpstart -s --> To generate system dump file (vmcore) from the secondary dump device.
# savecore -d <location> --> To generate the dump file (vmcore) manually after create.
# savecore -d /var/adm/ras
# sysdumpdev -L --> To list the last time or previously created dump device information.

LED code of Dump Device: 0c2
Recent Problems:
Problem: Dump file not generated
Reason: No enough space on /var file system to copy the dump file (vmcore).
(or) Primary dump device if /dev/sysdumpnull.
(or) No enough space Primary or Secondary dump device.
Issue Fixed:
Increased /var file system.
Increased Primary/Secondary dump device space

sysdumpdev					<--Changes the primary or secondary dump device designation in a running system. 
								The default primary dump device is LV /dev/hd6 and the default secondary dump device is /dev/sysdumpnull. 
								A dedicated primary dump device LV /dev/lg_dumplv is created (if sufficient disk space is available) in systems with at least 4 Gigabytes of real memory.
	# sysdumpdev -l : To list the primary & secondary dump devices information.
	# sysdumpdev -P -p /dev/hd7 : changes the primary dump device permanently from the default to LV /dev/hd7.
	# sysdumpdev -e : estimates the dump size (in bytes) for the current running system.
	# sysdumpdev -L : displays statistical information about the last dump.
	# chdev -l sys0 -a autostart=true : automatically reboot after a crash (default is false).

dumpcheck					<--Checks the disk resources used by the system dump and logs in the system error log. Run default by cron at 3:00 pm local time each day.
								/usr/lib/ras/dumpcheck -p : requests a dumpcheck. The result is printed to stdout (-p).
								/usr/lib/ras/dumpcheck -r : discontinues running dumpcheck (removes the crontab entry).

kdb							<--Displays system images for examining a dump.
								kdb /var/adm/ras/vmcore.0 /unix : starts kdb using the uncompressed dump file /var/adm/ras/vmcore.0 and kernel file /unix.

snap						<--Gathers system configuration information and compresses the information into a pax file.
								snap -a -o /dev/rmt0 : gathers all system configuration information (needs approximately 8 MB space in directory /tmp/ibmsupt) and creates a compressed pax image (snap.pax.Z) of directory /tmp/ibmsupt.

snapcore					<--Gathers the core file, program, and libraries used by a program to directory /tmp/snapcore (default) and compresses the information into a pax image. The collected information allows debugging and resolving problems within an application.
								snapcore -d /tmp/snapcore2 core.xx : gathers all needed information for core dump file core.xx and writes it to directory /tmp/snapcore2/snapcore_32811.pax.Z, where 32811 is the process id ($pid) of the snapcore command.
								uncompress -c snapcore_32811.pax.Z | pax : displays the contents of the pax archive.
								check_core	Used by snapcore to gather all information about a core dump. The bos.rte.serv_aid fileset must be installed.
								/usr/lib/ras/check_core core.xx : displays a list containing the program that caused core dump core.xx and the used libraries.

shconf						<--Manages the system hang detection parameters for the system hang daemon shdaemon.
								shconf -d : displays if priority problem detection and lost I/O detection are enabled or not.
								shconf -E -l prio -H : displays the current shdaemon settings.

dump						<--								 
								dump -ov /dir/xcoff-file

PROBLEM MANAGEMENT REQUEST (PMR):
When we are facing any software/hardware minor or major problems in the Aix servers, if Aix admin not able to fix the problems then we can contact to the IBM to open the PMR.
IBM Contact Number: 18004267378
Option1: Hardware Problems
Option2: Software problems
IBM will ask below details before Help us:
Hardware/Software problem?
Your Name
Your Company Name
Customer ID Ex: 21281138 (Disney Project)
Server Model #prtconf |more
Server Serial number
What is Aix OS Version installed
What is your problem
Your contact details (Phone, Mail IDs)
Priority of the PMR
Take your PMR number (63721 082 000)
63721 PMR number
082 Branch code
Then IBM will ask us to upload the server snap file into IBM site.
SNAP File:
The snap file contains/collect the total information about server. 
TO CREATE SNAP FILE:
#snap -r --> To remove the old SNAP file, before create new snap file.
#snap -gc or ac -->To create snap file
#cd /tmp/ibmsupt -> To enter snap file location
#ls -l snap*
rename the snap file with PMR number
#mv snap.pax.Z 63721.082.000.snap.pax.Z
Once snap is created/ready, Now we can upload the snap file into the IBM Site via FTP:
Software Site: testcase.software.ibm.com
Hardware Site: testcase.boulder.ibm.com
Suppose if Hardware case:
#ftp testcase.boulder.ibm.com
User name: anonymous
Passwd: surendra.s@hcl.com
#cd /toibm/hw --> Hardware snap file upload location
or /toibm/aix (For software snap file upload location)
#bin
#hash
#prompt
#put 63721.082.000.snap.pax.Z
NOTE: If we dont know how to upload the snap file, ask IBM technician He will provide total details/commands step by step to upload the snap file.
